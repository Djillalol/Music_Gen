**Prerequisites**

This Streamlit application requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

* streamlit
* tensorflow
* music21
* numpy
* json
* tqdm (optional, for progress tracking)

You can install these libraries using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install streamlit tensorflow music21 numpy json tqdm
```

**How to Run the Streamlit App**

1. **Save the Python Script:**
   Save the provided Python code snippet as a file named `music_generator.py`.

2. **Navigate to the Script Directory:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `music_generator.py` file.

3. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   Execute the following command in your terminal to launch the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run music_generator.py
   ```

   This will start the Streamlit app in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

**Explanation of the Script**

The `music_generator.py` script defines two main components:

1. **Generator Class:**
   - This class handles loading the pre-trained Keras model, music symbol mappings, and generating music sequences.
   - It provides methods for:
     - `generate_song`: Takes a seed melody, number of steps, sequence length, and temperature as input and generates a music sequence.
     - `_sample_with_temperature`: Samples a symbol from the model's output probabilities with a temperature for stochasticity.
     - `save_song`: Converts the generated music sequence into a MIDI file.

2. **Streamlit App:**
   - This section creates a user interface using Streamlit for interacting with the music generation process.
   - It includes:
     - Title and description of the app.
     - Button to generate a random seed melody.
     - Text area to display the generated seed.
     - Sliders to control the number of steps (length of the generated music) and temperature (stochasticity during generation).
     - Button to generate music based on the provided seed, number of steps, and temperature.
     - Success message and download link for the generated MIDI file.

**Using the Streamlit App**

1. **Generate Random Seed:** Click the "Generate Random Seed" button to create a starting melody for music generation. This seed consists of a sequence of musical pitches separated by underscores.

2. **Review Seed:** The generated seed melody will be displayed in the text area. You can modify this seed if you prefer a different starting point.

3. **Adjust Parameters:** Use the sliders to set the desired number of steps (length of the generated music) and temperature (stochasticity during generation). Higher temperatures lead to more diverse but potentially less coherent outputs.

4. **Generate Music:** Click the "Generate Music" button to initiate the music generation process based on the provided seed, number of steps, and temperature. The app will display an information message while generating the music.

5. **Download MIDI File:** Upon successful generation, a success message will be displayed along with a download link for the created MIDI file. Click the link to download and listen to the generated music.
